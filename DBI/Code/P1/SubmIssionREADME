-All test cases working


-How to run Code
Method 1

We made a small bash file to run the code
Just simply type 

    ./RunMe.bash 

and it should clean the code, compile and run all the test cases.

Method 2
All the files are precompiled so you can directly run the command
./test.out [0-11]


Method 3
In case you want to run manually, please follow these instructions

To compile the driver, type
    make clean
	make test.out

To run the driver, type 'test.out' followed by the query # you wish to execute
	./test.out [0-11]



Please note makefile is configured for Linux, if running Mac please try the code from Makefile Mac
This Milestone did not use many of the other files directly so we just compiled required files in test.cc make command
Didnt include bin files of tpch.

-Changes in test.cc
This time test.cc has a few typos and we generalized the functionality so that all column names had a table name at start.
