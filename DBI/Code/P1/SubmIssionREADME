-Where are results?
Results of running our Revised CNF on 1GB tpch data are stored as Result.log in main directory.

-How to run Code
Setup the three variables, dbfile_dir, tpch_dir, catalog_path in test.cc
Run the following commands to ensure it works:
make clean
make test.out
./test.out
Please note make file is configured for Linux, if running Mac please try the code from Makefile Mac

-Changes in test.cc
The test.cc file had no way of reading the supplier.tbl, so we added a last option to do that.

-Changes in CNF commands in README
The provided CNF commands in README were not working for us. 
So we made sure the CNF used capital letters, correct datatype and had no typos.
