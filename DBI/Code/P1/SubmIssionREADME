-Where are results?
Results of running CNF from README on 1GB tpch data are stored as Result.log in main directory.
PLEASE NOTE WE USED ONLY SORT NOT "SORT AND DISPLAY" FOR Result.log TO ENSURE A SENSABLE FILE SIZE.
THERE ARE MANY MESSAGES NOT WRITTEN INTO FILE DUE TO THIS.

-How to run Code
Setup the three variables, dbfile_dir, tpch_dir, catalog_path in test.cc
Run the following commands to ensure it works:
make clean
make test.out
./test.out
Please note make file is configured for Linux, if running Mac please try the code from Makefile Mac

-Changes in test.cc
The test.cc file had no way of reading the supplier.tbl, so we added a last option to do that.
