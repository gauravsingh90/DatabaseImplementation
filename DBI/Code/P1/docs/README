Compiler holds all the steps invoved in the execution query together
Steps involved in Query execution are :
	Build the relations using catalog.cc and statistics.cc
	Parse the query using parser.cc which inturn uses yyparser.
	Optimize the query execution tree using Optimize.cc
	Execute the query using Execute.cc
This is the abstract view of what ever is happening in the project 4 & 5

//Compile has object reference to all other classes 
it has a boolean array to keep track of what operations are present in query
And reference to root of the QueryTree to pass on to execute.
